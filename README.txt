Excursion Project:

In this project, you'll create a web page which advertises a product called "Excursion." You'll use your growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. You'll be proud of yourself when it all comes together!

The web page we'll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we'll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.

We'll work with Git and GitHub on our local machines, so if you haven't yet, refer to the articles on Command Line Interface Setup and Git Setup.
